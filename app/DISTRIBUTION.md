# Distributing CodeBurn Desktop

This document describes how to produce distributable macOS, Windows, and Linux
builds of the Electron desktop app. The macOS build is ad-hoc-signed and
**not notarized** (no paid Apple Developer account); the Windows and Linux
builds are **unsigned**. There is no CI automation for any of this yet (unlike
the CLI and menubar release processes in `../RELEASING.md`) — packaging is run
by hand on a maintainer's machine. All three targets are produced by
`electron-builder` and can be cross-built from a single macOS host.

## Prerequisite on the target machine: the codeburn CLI

The desktop app does not bundle the CLI — every screen gets its data by
spawning `codeburn`, resolved from the persisted path file, Homebrew/node
version-manager locations, or `PATH` (`electron/cli.ts`). On a machine
without it, the app launches into its "CLI not found" state until the user
runs:

```sh
npm install -g codeburn
```

Bundling `dist/cli.js` into the app (`extraResources` + spawning it with
Electron's own binary via `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`) is the known path to a
zero-dependency install; not implemented yet.

## Versioning

`app/package.json`'s `version` tracks the CLI's version (root
`package.json`) — one CodeBurn version across CLI, menubar, and desktop.
Bump it in the same change that bumps the root version; the splash, the
About dialog, and the artifact filenames all read it from there.

## Build

```sh
npm --prefix app install
npm --prefix app run package          # macOS, both arm64 and x64
npm --prefix app run package:arm64    # macOS arm64 only (faster on Apple Silicon)
npm --prefix app run package:x64      # macOS x64 only
npm --prefix app run package:win      # Windows NSIS installer, x64
npm --prefix app run package:linux    # Linux AppImage, x64
```

`package` runs `npm run build` (compiles `electron/` with `tsc`, builds the
renderer with `vite`) and then `electron-builder --mac`. `package:win` and
`package:linux` mirror it exactly, swapping the final flag for
`electron-builder --win` and `electron-builder --linux`. All three can run on
the same macOS host — electron-builder downloads the NSIS and AppImage tooling
on first use.

### Artifacts

electron-builder writes to `app/release/` (gitignored, like `dist/`):

- `CodeBurn-<version>-arm64.dmg`, `CodeBurn-<version>.dmg` — installer images
- `CodeBurn-<version>-arm64-mac.zip`, `CodeBurn-<version>-mac.zip` — zipped `.app` bundles
- `release/mac-arm64/CodeBurn.app`, `release/mac/CodeBurn.app` — the raw unpacked bundles (arm64 and x64 respectively)
- `.blockmap` files alongside each zip/dmg (used by electron-builder's differential-update mechanism; unused since this app has no auto-updater yet)

Both `dmg` and `zip` targets are built for both `arm64` and `x64` — four
artifacts total, not a universal binary. This keeps each download roughly
half the size of a universal build. Pick the zip if you just want to unpack
and drag to `/Applications`; the dmg gives users the familiar drag-to-Applications
installer window.

### Build configuration

The `build` block lives in `app/package.json` (small enough not to warrant a
separate `electron-builder.yml`):

- `appId: "org.agentseal.codeburn-desktop"` — reuses the `org.agentseal.*`
  prefix from the menubar app's bundle id (`org.agentseal.codeburn-menubar`,
  see `mac/Scripts/package-app.sh`); there is no `com.codeburn.*` bundle id
  anywhere in the codebase, so `org.agentseal.*` is the actual house
  convention.
- `productName: "CodeBurn"`.
- `files`: only `dist/electron/**/*`, `dist/renderer/**/*`, and `package.json`.
  The Electron main process has no npm runtime dependencies (only Node/Electron
  builtins — see `app/electron/cli.ts` and `app/electron/quota/*.ts`), and the
  renderer is a single Vite bundle, so `node_modules` does not need to ship at
  all.
- `mac.identity: "-"` — forces ad-hoc signing. **`identity: null` does NOT
  ad-hoc sign — it skips signing entirely**, which produces a bundle with a
  broken/absent seal (`codesign --verify --deep --strict` fails with
  `code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present`, and
  Apple Silicon refuses to run it at all). `"-"` is the same ad-hoc identity
  `mac/Scripts/package-app.sh` uses for the menubar app's local/CI builds.
- `mac.hardenedRuntime: false` — hardened runtime is for notarized builds;
  leaving it on for an ad-hoc signature with no entitlements can prevent the
  app from launching.
- `mac.gatekeeperAssess: false` — skips electron-builder's post-sign
  `spctl` check, which would always fail for an unnotarized app.
- `icon: build/icon.png` — a pre-existing 1024x1024 PNG at
  `app/build/icon.png`. No `.icns` exists in the repo; electron-builder
  generates one from the PNG at build time. This is the same source PNG
  used for the app icon; the menubar app has its own separate icon
  (`assets/menubar-logo.png`, converted to `.icns` in `package-app.sh`).
- `directories.output: "release"` — electron-builder's default output dir is
  `dist`, which collides with this app's existing `tsc`/`vite` build output
  (`app/dist/electron`, `app/dist/renderer`) that `files` reads from. Using
  a separate `release/` directory keeps build inputs and packaging outputs apart.

## Windows and Linux builds

Both are cross-built from the same macOS host used for the mac build — no
Windows or Linux machine, and no `wine`, is required. electron-builder 26
embeds the Windows executable's icon/version resources natively and downloads
the NSIS and AppImage tooling on first run.

### Windows (`package:win`)

`electron-builder --win` produces a single artifact in `app/release/`:

- **`CodeBurn Setup 0.9.15.exe`** — the NSIS installer (the version number
  tracks `package.json`; note the spaces in the filename). A `.exe.blockmap`
  is written alongside it (differential-update metadata, unused — no
  auto-updater yet).

Config (`build.win` + `build.nsis`):

- `win.target: nsis`, `arch: x64`.
- `win.icon: build/icon.png` — electron-builder converts the 1024x1024 PNG to
  a multi-resolution `.ico` at build time (same source PNG as the mac icon).
- `nsis.oneClick: false` — an assisted installer with a wizard, so users get
  an **install-directory choice** instead of a silent one-click install.
- `nsis.perMachine: false` — installs per-user (into the user's `AppData`),
  so **no administrator/UAC elevation** is needed.

**The build is UNSIGNED** (no Authenticode certificate). electron-builder logs
`signing with signtool.exe`, but with no certificate configured that step is a
no-op — the `.exe` ships without a signature. On first run, Windows SmartScreen
shows **"Windows protected your PC"**. Users click **"More info" → "Run
anyway"** to launch it. This is expected for an unsigned build; the only fix is
a purchased code-signing (Authenticode/EV) certificate.

### Linux (`package:linux`)

`electron-builder --linux` produces a single artifact in `app/release/`:

- **`CodeBurn-0.9.15.AppImage`** — a self-contained AppImage (no install step,
  no package manager).

Config (`build.linux`):

- `linux.target: AppImage`, `arch: x64`.
- `linux.category: "Development"` — the freedesktop menu category.
- `linux.icon: build/icon.png` — reuses the same source PNG.
- `linux.maintainer: "AgentSeal <hello@agentseal.org>"` — matches the root
  `package.json` author.
- `linux.executableName: "codeburn"` — the binary name inside the AppImage
  (lowercase, no spaces), distinct from the `CodeBurn` product name.

After downloading, the AppImage must be made executable before it will run:

```sh
chmod +x CodeBurn-0.9.15.AppImage
./CodeBurn-0.9.15.AppImage
```

The build logs one benign warning — `desktopName is not set` — which only
affects how some desktop environments group the app's windows in the
taskbar/dock; it does not affect packaging or launch.

## Releases

There is no release CI for the desktop app yet (see the note at the top). When
a maintainer cuts a desktop release by hand, the GitHub tag convention is:

```
desktop-v<version>      # e.g. desktop-v0.9.15
```

This mirrors the menubar's `mac-v<version>` convention (see `../RELEASING.md`)
and keeps the desktop app's tags in their own namespace, separate from the CLI
(`v<version>`) and the menubar (`mac-v<version>`). Upload all of the artifacts
above — the four macOS `.dmg`/`.zip` files, `CodeBurn-Setup-<version>.exe`,
and `CodeBurn-<version>.AppImage` — to the GitHub Release created at that
tag. The website's download links **pin that tag** in their URLs, so the
release name and the artifact filenames must match exactly. (The Windows
installer uses an explicit `nsis.artifactName` of
`CodeBurn-Setup-${version}.${ext}` — electron-builder's default contains
spaces, which make ugly percent-encoded URLs.)

## Verifying a build

```sh
codesign -dv --verbose=2 app/release/mac-arm64/CodeBurn.app
codesign --verify --deep --strict app/release/mac-arm64/CodeBurn.app
```

Expect `Signature=adhoc`, a real `Identifier=org.agentseal.codeburn-desktop`,
and `Sealed Resources` present. The deep-verify command should exit 0.

To smoke-test that the packaged renderer actually loads (the classic failure
is a white screen from a wrong `loadFile` path once assets are behind
`app.asar`), launch the built binary directly and confirm the process tree
stays up and the main process logs no `did-fail-load` errors:

```sh
"app/release/mac-arm64/CodeBurn.app/Contents/MacOS/CodeBurn" --user-data-dir=/tmp/codeburn-smoke
```

A healthy launch spawns `CodeBurn`, `CodeBurn Helper` (gpu-process),
`CodeBurn Helper` (utility/network), and `CodeBurn Helper (Renderer)`
processes and keeps running with no stderr output. `main.ts`'s
`did-fail-load` handler (`console.error('Renderer failed to load ...')`)
prints to that same stderr if the packaged `loadFile(path.join(__dirname,
'..', 'renderer', 'index.html'))` path is ever wrong.

## The Gatekeeper story (no paid Apple Developer account)

Ad-hoc signing satisfies the *kernel's* code-signing requirement (Apple
Silicon refuses to execute anything with no signature at all), but it is not
a Developer ID signature and the app is not notarized. Concretely:

- `spctl --assess --type execute` on the built app returns **`rejected`**,
  ad-hoc-signed or not, quarantined or not. `spctl`'s static assessment
  checks for a Developer ID + notarization ticket, which this build does
  not have and cannot have without a paid account.
- Any file downloaded through a browser (or unzipped by Finder's Archive
  Utility from a browser download) gets a `com.apple.quarantine` extended
  attribute. The first time a quarantined, non-notarized app is opened,
  Gatekeeper blocks a plain double-click with "Apple could not verify that
  \[CodeBurn] is free of malware."
- **This is expected and correct for an unpaid, unnotarized build.** Being
  a known GitHub author, signing the repo's commits, or ad-hoc signing the
  binary does **not** change this — none of that is a substitute for an
  Apple-issued Developer ID certificate plus notarization.

### First-open instructions for users

**Field-verified on macOS 15+ (Sequoia/Tahoe): an ad-hoc-signed, quarantined
app gets the harsher "\[CodeBurn] is damaged and can't be opened. You should
move it to the Trash." dialog, and the classic right-click → Open bypass does
NOT work for it** (that trick only helps Developer-ID-signed, unnotarized
apps). The reliable path is stripping the quarantine attribute:

```sh
# after dragging CodeBurn.app from the dmg into /Applications
xattr -cr /Applications/CodeBurn.app
```

One time only; subsequent launches work normally. **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway"** may also appear after a blocked attempt
and works when offered, but is not shown in all cases for ad-hoc builds —
document the `xattr` path as primary anywhere user-facing.

None of these steps are needed for a `dmg`/`zip` built and opened locally on
the same machine (no quarantine attribute is applied to files that were never
downloaded) — they only apply to a build distributed to someone else, e.g.
via a GitHub Release.

## Upgrade path: paid account + notarization

When a paid Apple Developer Program membership is available, the same
`electron-builder` config takes the upgrade with a few changes, no new
tooling:

- Set `mac.identity` to the real `"Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)"`
  certificate name (or let electron-builder auto-discover it from the
  keychain by removing `identity` entirely), and set `mac.hardenedRuntime:
  true` with an entitlements file.
- Add a `notarize` block (or the `afterSign` hook electron-builder's
  `@electron/notarize` integration expects) with an app-specific password or
  API key, and remove `gatekeeperAssess: false` so electron-builder verifies
  the notarized result itself.
- Everything else — `appId`, `files`, `mac.target` (dmg/zip, arm64+x64),
  `icon`, `directories.output` — stays as-is.
