## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- At least one supported AI coding tool with session data on disk
- For Cursor and OpenCode support, `better-sqlite3` is installed automatically as an optional dependency

## Install

```bash
npm install -g codeburn
```

Or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install codeburn
```

Or run directly without installing:

```bash
npx codeburn
bunx codeburn
dx codeburn
```

## Usage

```bash
codeburn                        # interactive dashboard (default: 7 days)
codeburn today                  # today's usage
codeburn month                  # this month's usage
codeburn report -p 30days       # rolling 30-day window
codeburn report -p all          # every recorded session
codeburn report --from 2026-04-01 --to 2026-04-10  # exact date range
codeburn report --format json   # full dashboard data as JSON
codeburn report --refresh 60    # auto-refresh every 60s (default: 30s)
codeburn status                 # compact one-liner (today + month)
codeburn status --format json
codeburn export                 # CSV with today, 7 days, 30 days
codeburn export -f json         # JSON export
codeburn optimize               # find waste, get copy-paste fixes
codeburn optimize -p week       # scope the scan to last 7 days
codeburn compare                # side-by-side model comparison
codeburn yield                  # track productive vs reverted/abandoned spend
codeburn yield -p 30days        # yield analysis for last 30 days
codeburn models                 # per-model token + cost table (last 30 days)
codeburn models --by-task       # explode each model into per-task-type rows
codeburn models --top 10        # only the top 10 by cost
codeburn models --format markdown      # paste-friendly markdown table
codeburn models --task feature         # filter to feature-development work
codeburn models --provider claude      # filter to one provider
```

Arrow keys switch between Today, 7 Days, 30 Days, Month, and 6 Months (use `--from` / `--to` for an exact historical window). Press `q` to quit, `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` as shortcuts, `c` to open model comparison, `o` to open optimize. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds by default (`--refresh 0` to disable). It also shows average cost per session and the five most expensive sessions across all projects.

Each provider doc lists the exact data location, storage format, and known quirks. Linux and Windows paths are detected automatically. If a path has changed or is wrong, please [open an issue](https://github.com/getagentseal/codeburn/issues).

CodeBurn auto-detects which AI coding tools you use. If multiple providers have session data on disk, press `p` in the dashboard to toggle between them.

The `--provider` flag filters any command to a single provider: `codeburn report --provider claude`, `codeburn today --provider codex`, `codeburn export --provider cursor`. Works on all commands: `report`, `today`, `month`, `status`, `export`, `optimize`, `compare`, `yield`.

### Provider Notes

**Cursor** reads token usage from its local SQLite database. Since Cursor's "Auto" mode hides the actual model used, costs are estimated using Sonnet pricing (labeled "Auto (Sonnet est.)" in the dashboard). The Cursor view shows a Languages panel instead of Core Tools/Shell/MCP panels, since Cursor does not log individual tool calls. First run on a large Cursor database may take up to a minute; results are cached and subsequent runs are instant.

**Gemini CLI** stores sessions as single JSON files. Each session embeds real token counts (input, output, cached, thoughts) per message, so no estimation is needed. Gemini reports input tokens inclusive of cached; CodeBurn subtracts cached from input before pricing to avoid double charging.

**Antigravity CLI** exposes exact usage through a short-lived local process while `agy` is running. Install the optional live hook with `codeburn antigravity-hook install` to capture short CLI sessions even when the menubar's 30-second refresh misses that window. The hook stores sanitized usage totals only, not prompts or local working-directory paths. Remove it with `codeburn antigravity-hook uninstall`; if `--force` replaced an existing statusLine command, uninstall restores that previous command.

**Mistral Vibe** stores sessions as folders under `~/.vibe/logs/session/` (or `$VIBE_HOME/logs/session/`). CodeBurn reads cumulative prompt/completion totals and model pricing from `meta.json`, then reads `messages.jsonl` for the first user prompt and assistant tool calls. Subagent sessions under `agents/` are counted as separate Vibe sessions.

**Kiro** stores conversations as `.chat` JSON files. Token counts are estimated from content length. The underlying model is not exposed, so sessions are labeled `kiro-auto` and costed at Sonnet rates.

**GitHub Copilot** reads from both `~/.copilot/session-state/` (legacy CLI) and VS Code/VSCodium `workspaceStorage/*/GitHub.copilot-chat/transcripts/`. The editor transcript format has no explicit token counts; tokens are estimated from content length and the model is inferred from tool call ID prefixes.

**OpenClaw** reads JSONL agent logs from `~/.openclaw/agents/` and also checks legacy paths (`.clawdbot`, `.moltbot`, `.moldbot`).

**Warp** reads Oz agent sessions from Warp's local `warp.sqlite`. Exchange-level token attribution is estimated from prompt-size weighting normalized to conversation totals, and `run_command` blocks are attached to the nearest preceding exchange by timestamp.

**Forge** reads conversations from `~/.forge/.forge.db`. Assistant usage entries provide prompt, completion, and cached token counts; CodeBurn emits one call per assistant message with usage and normalizes tool calls for breakdowns.

**Roo Code and KiloCode** are Cline-family VS Code extensions. CodeBurn reads `ui_messages.json` from each task directory and extracts token usage from `api_req_started` entries.

**Claude with multiple config directories.** If you run Claude Code under more than one account or profile (e.g. `~/.claude-work` and `~/.claude-personal`), point `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` at all of them at once: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS=~/.claude-work:~/.claude-personal codeburn`. Sessions across every directory are merged into one row per project so the totals reflect all your Claude usage in one place. Use `:` on POSIX, `;` on Windows. Missing or unreadable directories in the list are skipped.

Adding a new provider is a single file. See `src/providers/codex.ts` for an example.

## Features

### Cost Tracking

Prices every API call using input, output, cache read, cache write, and web search token counts. Fast mode multiplier for Claude. Pricing fetched from [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) and cached locally for 24 hours. Hardcoded fallbacks for all Claude and GPT models to prevent mispricing.

### Task Categories

13 categories classified from tool usage patterns and user message keywords. No LLM calls, fully deterministic.

| Category | What triggers it |
|---|---|
| Coding | Edit, Write tools |
| Debugging | Error/fix keywords + tool usage |
| Feature Dev | "add", "create", "implement" keywords |
| Refactoring | "refactor", "rename", "simplify" |
| Testing | pytest, vitest, jest in Bash |
| Exploration | Read, Grep, WebSearch without edits |
| Planning | EnterPlanMode, TaskCreate tools |
| Delegation | Agent tool spawns |
| Git Ops | git push/commit/merge in Bash |
| Build/Deploy | npm build, docker, pm2 |
| Brainstorming | "brainstorm", "what if", "design" |
| Conversation | No tools, pure text exchange |
| General | Skill tool, uncategorized |

### Breakdowns

Daily cost chart, per-project, per-model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, GPT-5, GPT-4o, Gemini, Kiro, and more), per-activity with one-shot rate, core tools, shell commands, and MCP servers.

### One-Shot Rate

For categories that involve code edits, CodeBurn tracks file-aware retry cycles. A retry is when the same file is re-edited after a shell command in between (Edit foo.ts, Bash, Edit foo.ts). Editing different files across shell steps is not a retry. The one-shot column shows the percentage of edit turns that succeeded without retries. Coding at 90% means the AI got it right first try 9 out of 10 times. File-level tracking is available for Claude, Codex, and Goose; other providers fall back to tool-name-based detection.

### Pricing

Fetched from [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) model prices (auto-cached 24 hours at `~/.cache/codeburn/`). Handles input, output, cache write, cache read, and web search costs. Fast mode multiplier for Claude. Hardcoded fallbacks for all Claude and GPT-5 models to prevent fuzzy matching mispricing.

### Optimize

```bash
codeburn optimize                       # scan the last 30 days
codeburn optimize -p today              # today only
codeburn optimize -p week               # last 7 days
codeburn optimize --provider claude     # restrict to one provider
```

Scans your sessions and your `~/.claude/` setup for waste patterns:

- Files Claude re-reads across sessions (same content, same context, over and over)
- Low Read:Edit ratio (editing without reading leads to retries and wasted tokens)
- Wasted bash output (uncapped `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, trailing noise)
- Unused MCP servers still paying their tool-schema overhead every session
- Ghost agents, skills, and slash commands defined in `~/.claude/` but never invoked
- Bloated `CLAUDE.md` files (with `@-import` expansion counted)
- Cache creation overhead and junk directory reads
- Context-heavy sessions where effective input/cache tokens swamp output
- Possibly low-worth expensive sessions with no edit turns or repeated retries
  when no `git`/`gh` delivery command is observed

Each finding shows the estimated token and dollar savings plus a ready-to-paste fix: a `CLAUDE.md` line, an environment variable, or a `mv` command to archive unused items. Findings are ranked by urgency (impact weighted against observed waste) and rolled up into an A to F setup health grade. Repeat runs classify each finding as new, improving, or resolved against a 48-hour recent window.

You can also open it inline from the dashboard: press `o` when a finding count appears in the status bar, `b` to return.

### Compare

```bash
codeburn compare                        # interactive model picker (default: last 6 months)
codeburn compare -p week                # last 7 days
codeburn compare -p today               # today only
codeburn compare --provider claude      # Claude Code sessions only
```

Or press `c` in the dashboard to enter compare mode. Arrow keys switch periods, `b` to return.

| Section | Metric | What it measures |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Performance | One-shot rate | Edits that succeed without retries |
| Performance | Retry rate | Average retries per edit turn |
| Performance | Self-correction | Turns where the model corrected its own mistake |
| Efficiency | Cost per call | Average cost per API call |
| Efficiency | Cost per edit | Average cost per edit turn |
| Efficiency | Output tokens per call | Average output tokens per call |
| Efficiency | Cache hit rate | Proportion of input from cache |

Also compares per-category one-shot rates, delegation rate, planning rate, average tools per turn, and fast mode usage.

### Yield

```bash
codeburn yield                  # last 7 days (default)
codeburn yield -p today         # today only
codeburn yield -p 30days        # last 30 days
codeburn yield -p month         # this calendar month
```

Correlates AI sessions with git commits by timestamp:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Productive | Commits from this session landed in main |
| Reverted | Commits were later reverted |
| Abandoned | No commits near session, or commits never merged |

Requires a git repository. Run from your project directory.

### Plans

```bash
codeburn plan set claude-max                                  # $200/month
codeburn plan set claude-pro                                  # $20/month
codeburn plan set cursor-pro                                  # $20/month
codeburn plan set custom --monthly-usd 200 --provider codex   # ChatGPT Pro-style custom plan
codeburn plan reset --provider codex                          # remove one provider plan
codeburn plan set none                                        # disable plan view
codeburn plan                                                 # show configured plans
codeburn plan reset                                           # remove plan config
```

Subscription tracking for Claude Pro, Claude Max, Cursor Pro, and custom provider plans. Plans are stored per provider, so you can track Claude and Codex/Cursor subscriptions at the same time; the dashboard shows one overage line per active provider plan. A legacy/custom `all` plan remains a single aggregate plan and is replaced when you add a provider-specific plan, avoiding double-counted overage rows. Existing single-plan config is still read as a fallback. Presets use publicly stated plan prices (as of April 2026); they do not model exact token allowances, because vendors do not publish precise consumer-plan limits.

### Currency

```bash
codeburn currency GBP          # set to British Pounds
codeburn currency AUD          # set to Australian Dollars
codeburn currency JPY          # set to Japanese Yen
codeburn currency CNY          # set to Chinese Yuan
codeburn currency              # show current setting
codeburn currency --reset      # back to USD
```

Any [ISO 4217 currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#List_of_ISO_4217_currency_codes) is supported (162 currencies). Exchange rates fetched from [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) (European Central Bank data, free, no API key) and cached for 24 hours. Config stored at `~/.config/codeburn/config.json`. The currency setting applies everywhere: dashboard, status bar, menu bar, CSV/JSON exports, and JSON API output.

### Model Aliases

If you see `$0.00` for some models, the model name reported by your provider does not match any entry in the LiteLLM pricing data. This commonly happens when using a proxy that rewrites model names.

```bash
codeburn model-alias "my-proxy-model" "claude-opus-4-6"   # add alias
codeburn model-alias --list                                # show configured aliases
codeburn model-alias --remove "my-proxy-model"             # remove alias
```

Aliases are stored in `~/.config/codeburn/config.json` and applied at runtime before pricing lookup. The target name can be anything in the [LiteLLM model list](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json) or a canonical name from the fallback table (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5`, `gpt-4o`). Built-in aliases ship for known proxy model name variants. User-configured aliases take precedence over built-ins.

### Filtering

```bash
codeburn report --project myapp                  # show only projects matching "myapp"
codeburn report --exclude myapp                  # show everything except "myapp"
codeburn report --exclude myapp --exclude tests  # exclude multiple projects
codeburn month --project api --project web       # include multiple projects
codeburn export --project inventory              # export only "inventory" project data
```

Filter by provider, project name (case-insensitive substring), or exact date range. The `--project` and `--exclude` flags work on all commands and can be combined with `--provider`.

```bash
codeburn report --from 2026-04-01 --to 2026-04-10   # explicit window
codeburn report --from 2026-04-01                    # this date through today
codeburn report --to 2026-04-10                      # earliest data through this date
```

Either flag alone is valid. Inverted or malformed dates exit with a clear error. In the TUI, the custom range sets the initial load only; pressing `1` through `5` switches back to predefined periods.

### JSON Output

`report`, `today`, and `month` support `--format json` to output the full dashboard data as structured JSON to stdout:

```bash
codeburn report --format json             # 7-day JSON report
codeburn today --format json              # today's data as JSON
codeburn month --format json              # this month as JSON
codeburn report -p 30days --format json   # 30-day window
```

The JSON includes all dashboard panels: overview (cost, calls, sessions, cache hit %), daily breakdown, projects (with `avgCostPerSession`), models with token counts, activities with one-shot rates, core tools, MCP servers, and shell commands. Pipe to `jq` for filtering:

```bash
codeburn report --format json | jq '.projects'
codeburn today --format json | jq '.overview.cost'
```

For lighter output, use `status --format json` (today and month totals only) or file exports (`export -f json`).

## Menu Bar

```bash
codeburn menubar
```

One command: downloads the latest `.app`, installs into `~/Applications`, and launches it. Re-run with `--force` to reinstall. Native Swift and SwiftUI app lives in `mac/` (see `mac/README.md` for build details).

The menubar icon shows the spend period selected in Settings (Today by default; Week, Month, and 6 Months are also available). Non-today periods add a short suffix such as `$42 / mo` so the menu bar value stays clear. Click to open a popover with agent tabs, period switcher (Today, 7 Days, 30 Days, Month, All), Trend, Forecast, Pulse, Stats, and Plan insights, activity and model breakdowns, optimize findings, and CSV/JSON export. Refreshes every 30 seconds.

You can also set the menubar status period from Terminal:

```bash
defaults write org.agentseal.codeburn-menubar CodeBurnMenubarPeriod -string month
```

Allowed values are `today`, `week`, `month`, and `sixMonths`. Relaunch the app to apply external defaults changes.

**Compact mode** shrinks the menubar item to fit the text, dropping decimals (e.g. `$110` instead of `$110.20`):

```bash
defaults write org.agentseal.codeburn-menubar CodeBurnMenubarCompact -bool true
```

Relaunch the app to apply. To revert: `defaults delete org.agentseal.codeburn-menubar CodeBurnMenubarCompact`.

## Reading the Dashboard

CodeBurn surfaces the data, you read the story. A few patterns worth knowing:

| Signal you see | What it might mean |
|---|---|
| Cache hit < 80% | System prompt or context is not stable, or caching not enabled |
| Lots of `Read` calls per session | Agent re-reading same files, missing context |
| Low 1-shot rate (Coding 30%) | Agent struggling with edits, retry loops |
| Opus 4.6 dominating cost on small turns | Overpowered model for simple tasks |
| `dispatch_agent` / `task` heavy | Sub-agent fan-out, expected or excessive |
| No MCP usage shown | Either you don't use MCP servers, or your config is broken |
| Bash dominated by `git status`, `ls` | Agent exploring instead of executing |
| Conversation category dominant | Agent talking instead of doing |

These are starting points, not verdicts. A 60% cache hit on a single experimental session is fine. A persistent 60% cache hit across weeks of work is a config issue.

## How It Reads Data

**Claude Code** stores session transcripts as JSONL at `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-path>/<session-id>.jsonl`. Each assistant entry contains model name, token usage (input, output, cache read, cache write), tool_use blocks, and timestamps.

**Codex** stores sessions at `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` with `token_count` events containing per-call and cumulative token usage, and `function_call` entries for tool tracking.

**Cursor** stores session data in a SQLite database at `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (macOS), `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (Linux), or `%APPDATA%/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (Windows). Token counts are in `cursorDiskKV` table entries with `bubbleId:` key prefix. Parsed results are cached at `~/.cache/codeburn/cursor-results.json` and auto-invalidate when the database changes.

**OpenCode** stores sessions in SQLite databases at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode*.db`. CodeBurn queries the `session`, `message`, and `part` tables read-only, extracts token counts and tool usage, and recalculates cost using the LiteLLM pricing engine. Falls back to OpenCode's own cost field for models not in our pricing data. Subtask sessions (`parent_id IS NOT NULL`) are excluded to avoid double counting. Supports multiple channel databases and respects `XDG_DATA_HOME`.

**Warp** stores Oz agent data in `~/Library/Group Containers/2BBY89MBSN.dev.warp/Library/Application Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/warp.sqlite` (with Preview fallback). CodeBurn reads `agent_conversations`, `ai_queries`, and `blocks`, emits one call per finalized exchange, estimates exchange token share from prompt-size weighting against conversation totals, and attributes `run_command` blocks to the nearest prior exchange.

**Forge** stores conversations in SQLite at `~/.forge/.forge.db`. CodeBurn queries `conversations` read-only, parses `context.messages`, subtracts cached tokens from prompt tokens for input pricing, and extracts tool calls plus shell commands from assistant messages.

**Pi / OMP** stores sessions as JSONL at `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<sanitized-cwd>/*.jsonl` (Pi) and `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<sanitized-cwd>/*.jsonl` (OMP). Each assistant message carries token usage (input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite) plus inline `toolCall` content blocks. CodeBurn extracts token counts, normalizes tool names to the standard set (`bash` to `Bash`, `dispatch_agent` to `Agent`), and pulls bash commands from `toolCall.arguments.command` for the shell breakdown.

**Codebuff** (formerly Manicode) stores per-chat history as JSON at `~/.config/manicode/projects/<project>/chats/<chatId>/chat-messages.json`. Codebuff bills in credits rather than tokens, so CodeBurn records each completed assistant message (via `msg.credits`) and approximates cost at the public pay-as-you-go rate ($0.01 / credit). When Codebuff routes a call through an upstream provider and the stashed RunState records token-level usage (`message.metadata.runState.sessionState.mainAgentState.messageHistory[*].providerOptions`), the real tokens and LiteLLM-calculated cost take precedence. Codebuff-native tool names (`read_files`, `str_replace`, `run_terminal_command`, `spawn_agents`, etc.) normalize to the canonical set (`Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Agent`). The `manicode-dev` and `manicode-staging` channels are walked automatically when present. Honors `CODEBUFF_DATA_DIR` for a custom root.

**Gemini CLI** stores sessions as single JSON files at `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.json`. Each session embeds real token counts (input, output, cached, thoughts) per message. Gemini reports input tokens inclusive of cached; CodeBurn subtracts cached from input before pricing to avoid double charging.

**Mistral Vibe** stores session folders at `~/.vibe/logs/session/`. Each folder contains `meta.json` with cumulative prompt/completion token totals, model pricing, timestamps, and working directory, plus `messages.jsonl` with user prompts and assistant tool calls. CodeBurn emits one record per Vibe session because the source data is cumulative, not per assistant turn.

**OpenClaw** stores agent sessions as JSONL at `~/.openclaw/agents/*.jsonl`. Also checks legacy paths `.clawdbot`, `.moltbot`, `.moldbot`. Token usage comes from assistant message `usage` blocks; model from `modelId` or `message.model` fields.

**Cline / Roo Code / KiloCode** are Cline-family coding agents. CodeBurn reads `ui_messages.json` from each task directory, filtering `type: "say"` entries with `say: "api_req_started"` to extract token counts. Cline scans both VS Code's `globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev` and `~/.cline/data`; Roo Code and KiloCode scan VS Code, VS Code Insiders, and VSCodium `globalStorage` roots.

**IBM Bob** stores IDE task history in `User/globalStorage/ibm.bob-code/tasks/<task-id>/` under the IBM Bob application data directory. CodeBurn reads `ui_messages.json` for API request token/cost records and `api_conversation_history.json` for the selected model, with support for both GA (`IBM Bob`) and preview (`Bob-IDE`) app data folders.

**Kimi Code CLI** stores session logs under `$KIMI_SHARE_DIR/sessions/<workdir-hash>/<session-id>/` or `~/.kimi/sessions/<workdir-hash>/<session-id>/`. CodeBurn reads `wire.jsonl` `StatusUpdate.token_usage` records, maps `input_other`, `input_cache_read`, `input_cache_creation`, and `output` into the standard token columns, and includes subagent sessions under each session's `subagents/` folder.

CodeBurn deduplicates messages (by API message ID for Claude, by cumulative token cross-check for Codex, by conversation/timestamp for Cursor, by session ID for Gemini, by session+message ID for OpenCode, by responseId for Pi/OMP, by chat folder + message ID for Codebuff, by session+message ID for Kimi), filters by date range per entry, and classifies each turn.
